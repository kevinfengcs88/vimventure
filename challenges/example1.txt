The stars above, a night's embrace,
Where dreams take flight and leave no trace.
A gentle breeze, the moon aglow,
Whispering secrets as rivers flow.
Mountains tall, reaching for the sky,
In nature's beauty, hearts can't deny.
Love's tender touch, a guiding light,
Through darkest hours, a beacon bright.
Time's fleeting dance, a fleeting kiss,
In every moment, eternal bliss.
